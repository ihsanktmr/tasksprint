### 3. Contribute Code üíª

Want to write some code? Awesome! Follow these steps:

1. **Fork the repository**:  
   Click the `Fork` button at the top-right corner of the repository page to create your own copy of the project.
2. **Clone your fork**:

   Clone your forked repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ihsanktmr/tasksprint.git
   ```

3. **Create a new branch**:

   Always create a new branch for your changes. It keeps things organized and makes it easier for us to review your contribution.

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-name
   ```

4. **Make changes**:
   Make your changes or additions. Be sure to test them locally to ensure they work as expected.

5. **Write clear and concise commit messages:**:

   - Each commit should contain a single change or logical group of changes.
   - Follow the format

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add: [short description of your change]"
   ```

   - Example: `git commit -m "Fix: correct bug in login validation"`
   - Important: Ensure your commit messages are descriptive and follow the project's style guide. For example, use the present tense for descriptions.

6. **Push your changes**:
   Once you're happy with your changes, push them to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature-name
   ```

7. **Open a Pull Request**:

- Navigate to the original repository where you want to submit your changes.
- Open a Pull Request (PR) from your fork.
- In the PR description, provide:
  - A detailed description of what changes you made.
  - Reference any related issues by including keywords like `Fixes #issue-number` or `Closes #issue-number`
  - If applicable, provide screenshots or GIFs to illustrate any UI changes.

## General Guidelines

**Follow the code style:**
Ensure your code follows the project‚Äôs style guide. This includes consistent indentation, naming conventions, and structure.

**Test locally:**
Run the project and make sure all tests pass before submitting a PR. This helps us catch any bugs early.

**Write clear commit messages:**
Each commit should clearly explain what was done and why. A good commit message is essential for project maintainability.

**Keep PRs small:**
Smaller, focused PRs are easier to review and merge. Avoid adding multiple features or bug fixes in a single PR.

Thank you for your contribution! üéâ We look forward to reviewing your code!
